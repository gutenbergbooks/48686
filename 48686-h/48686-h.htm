<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>Ay, truly&mdash;they have just chaunted a solemn requiem
in annual memory of the king's departed
sister&mdash;and now, a merry occasion calls them forth
to meet our good old king himself, who has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
fighting for his people, conquered his foes, and deserves
the thanks of all his friends.</p>

<p class="center">Second <span class="smcap">Citizen</span>.</p>

<p>Then why stand we here?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>Why not? The king will pass through that gate,
for the opening of which we have so long waited&mdash;and
instead of going to the <i>show</i>, if we tarry a few moments,
the <i>show</i> will come to us.</p>

<p class="center">Third <span class="smcap">Citizen</span>.</p>

<p>They say the king's favourite, young Valentine,
hath gained great honour in these wars.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>That he hath:&mdash;and humble though I seem, I have
helped him to no small part of it.</p>

<p class="center">All.</p>

<p>You!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>To be sure&mdash;I made the very sword with which
he slew the Saracens; and I defy any man to be
killed with a better tempered weapon. Oh! I'll be
bound he laid about him.&mdash;He had 'em here, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
he had 'em there. (<i>Flourishing his stick to the annoyance
of the mob.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">Second <span class="smcap">Citizen</span>.</p>

<p>But, friend Hugo, why shou'd the king lavish so
much favour on a foundling?</p>

<p class="center">Old <span class="smcap">Woman</span>.</p>

<p>Aye, aye, he was found in a forest&mdash;Well, well,
when great men go a-hunting, and find children in
the woods, it's time for the fair sex to look about
'em.</p>

<p class="center">Third <span class="smcap">Citizen</span>.</p>

<p>And mark the end of it&mdash;In that very spot where
Valentine was found, there has suddenly appeared a
strange wild man, some say he is fourteen feet high.</p>

<p class="center">Second <span class="smcap">Citizen</span>.</p>

<p>No, no; thirteen feet and a half.</p>

<p class="center">Third <span class="smcap">Citizen</span>.</p>

<p>Who, to feed an old weather-beaten she-bear,
bears down all before him.</p>

<p class="center">First <span class="smcap">Citizen</span>.</p>

<p>Nay, but Valentine is well-beloved among us too:
the old men admire him, and his courtesy has gained
him the hearts of all the young women.</p>

There's Henry and Haufray, the cousins of the king,

to want to be heir to the throne, by marrying the
king's daughter, the Princess Eglantine; and the
other conceits himself to be the only man in the

our victorious armies. Stand aside!&mdash;Here come all

accompanied a weak, defenceless woman?</p>

<p>Never shall I forget when, wearied with anguish

with mournful sound scattered the falling leaves&mdash;meanwhile
your groans were echoed by the distant
murmur of nightly prowling wolves.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Belisanta.</span></p>

<p>When, at my request you left me, in the hope of
finding human aid, two babes, the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: offpring">offspring</span> of my
unkind husband, first saw the light. Starting with
agony, these eyes beheld one of my children in the
savage gripe of a most hideous bear. One desperate
effort, short as furious, impelled me to attempt pursuit.
I fell, and knew no more of sense, till from a
peasant's wife I learned that she had found and
borne me to her humble dwelling.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Blandiman.</span></p>

<p>I wandered far, till the sound of horns led me to
where I met the king, who with a frown at hearing of
your name, on pain of death, warned me to leave
his presence.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Belisanta.</span></p>

<p>Vainly I sought my infant left behind&mdash;reason a

cloathed in the garb of patience, brought me peace.</p>

of the cruel treacheries employed against
me, ne'er to be known but as a sister of this order.</p>

to <span class="smcap">Orson</span> that he must shake hands with his friends&mdash;he
takes a hand of each, and squeezes them violently&mdash;he
then shakes hands with the others&mdash;<span class="smcap">Eglantine</span>

astonished, delighted at her beauty, he runs to embrace
her, as <span class="smcap">Valentine</span> has done, but is repulsed and much
displeased at it&mdash;<span class="smcap">Valentine</span> makes him kneel and
kiss her hand&mdash;drums and trumpets are heard, the wild

runs for protection to <span class="smcap">Valentine</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Orson</span> seems
hurt, and makes a savage kind of moaning&mdash;the <span class="smcap">King</span>
admires <span class="smcap">Orson</span>, who wants to shake hands with him,
but is taught the proper mode of approaching him by
<span class="smcap">Valentine</span>&mdash;the <span class="smcap">King</span> orders <span class="smcap">Orson</span> a dress, and
goes off with the Princess and attendants&mdash;<span class="smcap">Valentine</span>
and <span class="smcap">Orson</span> are following, when the latter espies <span class="smcap">Hugo</span>,
and remembering the adventure of the cloak in the forest,
runs furiously towards him, and reminds him of it by
action&mdash;<span class="smcap">Valentine</span> interposes in behalf of his terrified
armour-bearer, whom he reconciles to <span class="smcap">Orson</span>, and
leaves them together&mdash;Attendants bring on apparel, as
ordered by the <span class="smcap">King</span>, for <span class="smcap">Orson</span>, who makes many
whimsical mistakes in putting it on, when suddenly missing
<span class="smcap">Valentine</span>, he throws the dress at the Officers,
and runs into the palace in search of his friend.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-Enter <span class="smcap">Hugo</span>.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>Ha! ha! ha! the wild man has began to shew
his breeding with a vengeance&mdash;he has overturned
the kitchen, set the cellar afloat, and sent every thing
in the stable to rack and manger; for he hath eaten
the beast's provender, given wine to the horses, and
thrown the cook into the dripping pan, where he
basted him with his own ladle.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Agatha</span>.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Agatha.</span></p>

<p>Ah, Hugo&mdash;what, are you laughing at the wild
man? I'm sure he frightens me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>He'd have frightened you more, if you had seen
him, as I did, in his own dining room in the forest.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Agatha.</span></p>

<p>Why now, really, had you courage enough to
venture there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>To be sure I had&mdash;I went in boldly&mdash;by mistake.</p>
<p class="right">(<i>Aside.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Agatha.</span></p>

<p>When he was out, I suppose?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>O, no; he was there, and wanted me to stay. I
took off my cloak to oblige him, and to avoid ceremony,
came away without it. Your lady may well
be glad that Valentine had power to tame him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Agatha.</span></p>

<p>Glad! she's more uneasy than ever; and if she
hasn't fallen <i>out</i> of <i>love</i> into <i>jealousy</i>, I'll give you
leave to say that Agatha is no conjuror.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>I'm sure I never said you was one: but who is
she jealous of?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Agatha.</span></p>

<p>You shall hear. The Duke of Acquitane has
arrived to beg relief against a pagan, they call the
Green Knight, who holds his daughter unlawfully
a prisoner, and unless, by a certain hour she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
rescued, she will be forced to marry this Saracen
monster, who has already vanquished and hanged
up twenty knights who fought for her.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>Poor fellows! And what is he to have who conquers
the pagan?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Agatha.</span></p>

<p>The lady's hand.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>Hanging on one side, and marriage on the other!
bless me! Where could they find twenty knights
mad enough to undertake such a terrible alternative?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Agatha.</span></p>

<p>Why; your master, Valentine, will go, if it's
only for the honour of the thing: and the Princess
is distracted lest he should fall in love with the lady,
or be killed by the knight.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hugo.</span></p>

<p>And for fear he shou'd once more ask me to bear
him company I'll get out of the way as fast as
possible.</p>

<p>It wou'd be a sad thing, truly, my dear lady;

<p>There is a prophecy, that no <i>man nursed by woman</i>

the Saracen; or else as pagan sorcery, which he, a
